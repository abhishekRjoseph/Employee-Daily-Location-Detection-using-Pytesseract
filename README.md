Employee Daily Location Detection using Pytesseract

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect the daily location of employees using Pytesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that can recognize text within an image. The system will be able to read and interpret location data from images of employee check-in or check-out logs, and store the location data in a database.
The system will involve the following steps:
1.	Image Capture: The system will capture images of employee check-in or check-out logs, either from a camera or from a folder on a local computer.
2.	Image Pre-processing: The system will pre-process the captured images to enhance the text and remove any noise or unwanted information. This may involve techniques such as binarization, thresholding, and image filtering.
3.	Text Recognition: The pre-processed images will be fed into Pytesseract for text recognition. Pytesseract will analyze the images and recognize the location data contained within them.
4.	Data Storage: The location data will be stored in a database, such as MySQL or SQLite, along with other relevant employee information such as their name, ID number, and time of check-in or check-out.
5.	Location Analysis: The system will be able to generate reports and visualizations of employee location data, such as maps or charts that show which locations are most frequently visited, or which employees are consistently late or absent.

The system will be useful for organizations that need to keep track of their employees' daily locations, such as companies with remote workers or large facilities. It can help to improve employee accountability, monitor employee performance, and optimize business operations.

Overall, this project will require proficiency in Python programming, image processing, OCR, and database management. It may also involve the use of additional libraries or tools such as OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
